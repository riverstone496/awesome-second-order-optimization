## K-FAC

- Optimizing Neural Networks with Kronecker-factored Approximate Curvature [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05671)
  - James Martens, Roger Grosse.
  - 2015
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose an efficient method for approximating natural gradient descent in neural networks which we call Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC). K-FAC is based on an efficiently invertible approximation of a neural network's Fisher information matrix which is neither diagonal nor low-rank, and in some cases is completely non-sparse. It is derived by approximating various large blocks of the Fisher (corresponding to entire layers) as being the Kronecker product of two much smaller matrices. While only several times more expensive to compute than the plain stochastic gradient, the updates produced by K-FAC make much more progress optimizing the objective, which results in an algorithm that can be much faster than stochastic gradient descent with momentum in practice. And unlike some previously proposed approximate natural-gradient/Newton methods which use high-quality non-diagonal curvature matrices (such as Hessian-free optimization), K-FAC works very well in highly stochastic optimization regimes. This is because the cost of storing and inverting K-FAC's approximation to the curvature matrix does not depend on the amount of data used to estimate it, which is a feature typically associated only with diagonal or low-rank approximations to the curvature matrix.

- A Kronecker-factored approximate Fisher matrix for convolution layers [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01407)
  - Roger Grosse, James Martens.
  - 2016
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Second-order optimization methods such as natural gradient descent have the potential to speed up training of neural networks by correcting for the curvature of the loss function. Unfortunately, the exact natural gradient is impractical to compute for large models, and most approximations either require an expensive iterative procedure or make crude approximations to the curvature. We present Kronecker Factors for Convolution (KFC), a tractable approximation to the Fisher matrix for convolutional networks based on a structured probabilistic model for the distribution over backpropagated derivatives. Similarly to the recently proposed Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC), each block of the approximate Fisher matrix decomposes as the Kronecker product of small matrices, allowing for efficient inversion. KFC captures important curvature information while still yielding comparably efficient updates to stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We show that the updates are invariant to commonly used reparameterizations, such as centering of the activations. In our experiments, approximate natural gradient descent with KFC was able to train convolutional networks several times faster than carefully tuned SGD. Furthermore, it was able to train the networks in 10-20 times fewer iterations than SGD, suggesting its potential applicability in a distributed setting.

- Kronecker-factored Curvature Approximations for Recurrent Neural Networks [[paper]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyMTkQZAb)
  - James Martens, Jimmy Ba, Matt Johnson.
  - 2018
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Kronecker-factor Approximate Curvature (Martens & Grosse, 2015) (K-FAC) is a 2nd-order optimization method which has been shown to give state-of-the-art performance on large-scale neural network optimization tasks (Ba et al., 2017).  It is based on an approximation to the Fisher information matrix (FIM) that makes assumptions about the particular structure of the network and the way it is parameterized. The original K-FAC method was applicable only to fully-connected networks, although it has been recently extended by Grosse & Martens (2016) to handle convolutional networks as well. In this work we extend the method to handle RNNs by introducing a novel approximation to the FIM for RNNs. This approximation works by modelling the covariance structure between the gradient contributions at different time-steps using a chain-structured linear Gaussian graphical model, summing the various cross-covariances, and computing the inverse in closed form. We demonstrate in experiments that our method significantly outperforms general purpose state-of-the-art optimizers like SGD with momentum and Adam on several challenging RNN training tasks.

- Fast Approximate Natural Gradient Descent in a Kronecker-factored Eigenbasis [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03884)
  - Thomas George, César Laurent, Xavier Bouthillier, Nicolas Ballas, Pascal Vincent.
  - 2018
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Optimization algorithms that leverage gradient covariance information, such as variants of natural gradient descent (Amari, 1998), offer the prospect of yielding more effective descent directions. For models with many parameters, the covariance matrix they are based on becomes gigantic, making them inapplicable in their original form. This has motivated research into both simple diagonal approximations and more sophisticated factored approximations such as KFAC (Heskes, 2000; Martens & Grosse, 2015; Grosse & Martens, 2016). In the present work we draw inspiration from both to propose a novel approximation that is provably better than KFAC and amendable to cheap partial updates. It consists in tracking a diagonal variance, not in parameter coordinates, but in a Kronecker-factored eigenbasis, in which the diagonal approximation is likely to be more effective. Experiments show improvements over KFAC in optimization speed for several deep network architectures.

- Eigenvalue-corrected Natural Gradient Based on a New Approximation [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13609)

  - 2020
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Using second-order optimization methods for training deep neural networks (DNNs) has attracted many researchers. A recently proposed method, Eigenvalue-corrected Kronecker Factorization (EKFAC) (George et al., 2018), proposes an interpretation of viewing natural gradient update as a diagonal method, and corrects the inaccurate re-scaling factor in the Kronecker-factored eigenbasis. Gao et al. (2020) considers a new approximation to the natural gradient, which approximates the Fisher information matrix (FIM) to a constant multiplied by the Kronecker product of two matrices and keeps the trace equal before and after the approximation. In this work, we combine the ideas of these two methods and propose Trace-restricted Eigenvalue-corrected Kronecker Factorization (TEKFAC). The proposed method not only corrects the inexact re-scaling factor under the Kronecker-factored eigenbasis, but also considers the new approximation method and the effective damping technique proposed in Gao et al. (2020). We also discuss the differences and relationships among the Kronecker-factored approximations. Empirically, our method outperforms SGD with momentum, Adam, EKFAC and TKFAC on several DNNs.

  - 2021
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The bottleneck of computation burden limits the widespread use of the 2nd order optimization algorithms for training deep neural networks. In this paper, we present a computationally efficient approximation for natural gradient descent, named Swift Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (SKFAC), which combines Kronecker factorization and a fast low-rank matrix inversion technique. Our research aims at both fully connected and convolutional layers. For the fully connected layers, by utilizing the low-rank property of Kronecker factors of Fisher information matrix, our method only requires inverting a small matrix to approximate the curvature with desirable accuracy. For convolutional layers, we propose a way with two strategies to save computational efforts without affecting the empirical performance by reducing across the spatial dimension or receptive fields of feature maps. Specifically, we propose two effective dimension reduction methods for this purpose: Spatial Subsampling and Reduce Sum. Experimental results of training several deep neural networks on Cifar-10 and ImageNet-1k datasets demonstrate that SKFAC can capture the main curvature and yield comparative performance to K-FAC. The proposed method bridges the wall-clock time gap between the 1st and 2nd order algorithms.

- M-FAC: Efficient Matrix-Free Approximations of Second-Order Information [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03356)
  - Elias Frantar, Eldar Kurtic, Dan Alistarh.
  - 2021
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Efficiently approximating local curvature information of the loss function is a key tool for optimization and compression of deep neural networks. Yet, most existing methods to approximate second-order information have high computational or storage costs, which can limit their practicality. In this work, we investigate matrix-free, linear-time approaches for estimating Inverse-Hessian Vector Products (IHVPs) for the case when the Hessian can be approximated as a sum of rank-one matrices, as in the classic approximation of the Hessian by the empirical Fisher matrix. We propose two new algorithms as part of a framework called M-FAC: the first algorithm is tailored towards network compression and can compute the IHVP for dimension d, if the Hessian is given as a sum of m rank-one matrices, using O(dm2) precomputation, O(dm) cost for computing the IHVP, and query cost O(m) for any single element of the inverse Hessian. The second algorithm targets an optimization setting, where we wish to compute the product between the inverse Hessian, estimated over a sliding window of optimization steps, and a given gradient direction, as required for preconditioned SGD. We give an algorithm with cost O(dm+m2) for computing the IHVP and O(dm+m3) for adding or removing any gradient from the sliding window. These two algorithms yield state-of-the-art results for network pruning and optimization with lower computational overhead relative to existing second-order methods. Implementations are available at [9] and [17].

  - 2021
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Second-order methods have shown state-of-the-art performance for optimizing deep neural networks. Nonetheless, their large memory requirement and high computational complexity, compared to first-order methods, hinder their versatility in a typical low-budget setup. This paper introduces a general framework of layerwise loss construction for multilayer neural networks that achieves a performance closer to second-order methods while utilizing first-order optimizers only. Our methodology lies upon a three-component loss, target, and regularizer combination, for which altering each component results in a new update rule. We provide examples using squared loss and layerwise Bregman divergences induced by the convex integral functions of various transfer functions. Our experiments on benchmark models and datasets validate the efficacy of our new approach, reducing the gap between first-order and second-order optimizers.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> It is well-known that second-order optimizer can accelerate the training of deep neural networks, however, the huge computation cost of second-order optimization makes it impractical to apply in real practice. In order to reduce the cost, many methods have been proposed to approximate a second-order matrix. Inspired by KFAC, we propose a novel Trace-based Hardware-driven layer-ORiented Natural Gradient Descent Computation method, called THOR, to make the second-order optimization applicable in the real application models. Specifically, we gradually increase the update interval and use the matrix trace to determine which blocks of Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) need to be updated. Moreover, by resorting the power of hardware, we have designed a Hardware-driven approximation method for computing FIM to achieve better performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of THOR, we have conducted extensive experiments. The results show that training ResNet-50 on ImageNet with THOR only takes 66.7 minutes to achieve a top-1 accuracy of 75.9 % under an 8 Ascend 910 environment with MindSpore, a new deep learning computing framework. Moreover, with more computational resources, THOR can only takes 2.7 minutes to 75.9 % with 256 Ascend 910.

- Gradient Descent on Neurons and its Link to Approximate Second-Order Optimization [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12250)
  - Frederik Benzing.
  - 2022
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Second-order optimizers are thought to hold the potential to speed up neural network training, but due to the enormous size of the curvature matrix, they typically require approximations to be computationally tractable. The most successful family of approximations are Kronecker-Factored, block-diagonal curvature estimates (KFAC). Here, we combine tools from prior work to evaluate exact second-order updates with careful ablations to establish a surprising result: Due to its approximations, KFAC is not closely related to second-order updates, and in particular, it significantly outperforms true second-order updates. This challenges widely held believes and immediately raises the question why KFAC performs so well. Towards answering this question we present evidence strongly suggesting that KFAC approximates a first-order algorithm, which performs gradient descent on neurons rather than weights. Finally, we show that this optimizer often improves over KFAC in terms of computational cost and data-efficiency.

- Eva: A General Vectorized Approximation Framework for Second-order Optimization [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02123)
  - Lin Zhang, Shaohuai Shi, Bo Li.
  - 2022
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Second-order optimization algorithms exhibit excellent convergence properties for training deep learning models, but often incur significant computation and memory overheads. This can result in lower training efficiency than the first-order counterparts such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In this work, we present a memory- and time-efficient second-order algorithm named Eva with two novel techniques: 1) we construct the second-order information with the Kronecker factorization of small stochastic vectors over a mini-batch of training data to reduce memory consumption, and 2) we derive an efficient update formula without explicitly computing the inverse of matrices using the Sherman-Morrison formula. We further extend Eva to a general vectorized approximation framework to improve the compute and memory efficiency of two existing second-order algorithms (FOOF and Shampoo) without affecting their convergence performance. Extensive experimental results on different models and datasets show that Eva reduces the end-to-end training time up to 2.05x and 2.42x compared to first-order SGD and second-order algorithms (K-FAC and Shampoo), respectively.

- HyLo: a hybrid low-rank natural gradient descent method [[paper]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3571885.3571947)
  - Baorun Mu, Saeed Soori, Bugra Can, M. Gürbüzbalaban, M. Dehnavi.
  - 2022
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This work presents a Hybrid Low-Rank Natural Gradient Descent method, called HyLo, that accelerates the training time of deep neural networks. Natural gradient descent (NGD) requires computing the inverse of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), which is typically expensive at large-scale. Kronecker factorization methods such as KFAC attempt to improve NGD's running time by approximating the FIM with Kronecker factors. However, the size of Kronecker factors increases quadratically as the model size grows. Instead, in HyLo, we use the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury variant of NGD (SNGD) and propose a reformulation of SNGD to resolve its scalability issues. HyLo uses a computationally-efficient low-rank factorization to achieve superior timing for Fisher inverses. We evaluate HyLo on large models including ResNet-50, U-Net, and ResNet-32 on up to 64 GPUs. HyLo converges 1.4×-2.1× faster than the state-of-the-art distributed implementation of KFAC and reduces the computation and communication time up to 350× and 10.7× on ResNet-50.

- MKOR: Momentum-Enabled Kronecker-Factor-Based Optimizer Using Rank-1 Updates [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01685)
  - Mohammad Mozaffari, Sikan Li, Zhao Zhang, Maryam Mehri Dehnavi.
  - 2023
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This work proposes a Momentum-Enabled Kronecker-Factor-Based Optimizer Using Rank-1 updates, called MKOR, that improves the training time and convergence properties of deep neural networks (DNNs). Second-order techniques, while enjoying higher convergence rates vs first-order counterparts, have cubic complexity with respect to either the model size and/or the training batch size. Hence they exhibit poor scalability and performance in transformer models, e.g. large language models (LLMs), because the batch sizes in these models scale by the attention mechanism sequence length, leading to large model size and batch sizes. MKOR's complexity is quadratic with respect to the model size, alleviating the computation bottlenecks in second-order methods. Because of their high computation complexity, state-of-the-art implementations of second-order methods can only afford to update the second order information infrequently, and thus do not fully exploit the promise of better convergence from these updates. By reducing the communication complexity of the second-order updates as well as achieving a linear communication complexity, MKOR increases the frequency of second order updates. We also propose a hybrid version of MKOR (called MKOR-H) that mid-training falls backs to a first order optimizer if the second order updates no longer accelerate convergence. Our experiments show that MKOR outperforms state -of-the-art first order methods, e.g. the LAMB optimizer, and best implementations of second-order methods, i.e. KAISA/KFAC, up to 2.57x and 1.85x respectively on BERT-Large-Uncased on 64 GPUs.

## Distributed K-FAC

  - Jimmy Ba, Roger Grosse, James Martens
  - 2017
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> As more computational resources become available, machine learning researchers train ever larger neural networks on millions of data points using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Although SGD scales well in terms of both the size of dataset and the number of parameters of the model, it has rapidly diminishing returns as parallel computing resources increase.  Second-order optimization methods have an affinity for well-estimated gradients and large mini-batches, and can therefore benefit much more from parallel computation in principle.   Unfortunately,  they often employ severe approximations to the curvature matrix in order to scale to large models with millions of parameters, limiting their effectiveness in practice versus well-tuned SGD with momentum.  The recently proposed K-FAC method(Martens and Grosse, 2015) uses a stronger and more sophisticated curvature approximation, and has been shown to make much more per-iteration progress than SGD, while only introducing a modest overhead.  In this paper, we develop a version of K-FAC that distributes the computation of gradients and additional quantities required by K-FAC across multiple machines, thereby taking advantage of method’s superior scaling to large mini-batches and mitigating its additional overheads. We provide a Tensorflow implementation of our approach which is easy to use and can be applied to many existing codebases without modification.  Additionally, we develop several algorithmic enhancements to K-FAC which can improve its computational performance for very large models. Finally, we show that our distributed K-FAC method speeds up training of various state-of-the-art ImageNet classification models by a factor of two compared to Batch Normalization(Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015).

Previous approaches try to solve this problem by varying the learning rate and batch size over epochs and layers, or some ad hoc modification of the batch normalization. We propose an alternative approach using a second-order optimization method that shows similar generalization capability to first-order methods, but converges faster and can handle larger mini-batches. To test our method on a benchmark where highly optimized first-order methods are available as references, we train ResNet-50 on ImageNet. We converged to 75% Top-1 validation accuracy in 35 epochs for mini-batch sizes under 16,384, and achieved 75% even with a mini-batch size of 131,072, which took only 978 iterations.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Large-scale distributed training of deep neural networks results in models with worse generalization performance as a result of the increase in the effective mini-batch size. Previous approaches attempt to address this problem by varying the learning rate and batch size over epochs and layers, or ad hoc modifications of batch normalization. We propose Scalable and Practical Natural Gradient Descent (SP-NGD), a principled approach for training models that allows them to attain similar generalization performance to models trained with first-order optimization methods, but with accelerated convergence. Furthermore, SP-NGD scales to large mini-batch sizes with a negligible computational overhead as compared to first-order methods. We evaluated SP-NGD on a benchmark task where highly optimized first-order methods are available as references: training a ResNet-50 model for image classification on ImageNet. We demonstrate convergence to a top-1 validation accuracy of 75.4% in 5.5 minutes using a mini-batch size of 32,768 with 1,024 GPUs, as well as an accuracy of 74.9% with an extremely large mini-batch size of 131,072 in 873 steps of SP-NGD.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Rich information matrices from first and second-order derivatives have many potential applications in both theoretical and practical problems in deep learning. However, computing these information matrices is extremely expensive and this enormous cost is currently limiting its application to important problems regarding generalization, hyperparameter tuning, and optimization of deep neural networks. One of the most challenging use cases of information matrices is their use as a preconditioner for the optimizers, since the information matrices need to be updated every step. In this work, we conduct a step-by-step performance analysis when computing the Fisher information matrix during training of ResNet-50 on ImageNet, and show that the overhead can be reduced to the same amount as the cost of performing a single SGD step. We also show that the resulting Fisher preconditioned optimizer can converge in 1/3 the number of epochs compared to SGD, while achieving the same Top-1 validation accuracy. This is the first work to achieve such accuracy with K-FAC while reducing the training time to match that of SGD.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Training neural networks with many processors can reduce time-to-solution; however, it is challenging to maintain convergence and efficiency at large scales. The Kronecker-factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) was recently proposed as an approximation of the Fisher Information Matrix that can be used in natural gradient optimizers. We investigate here a scalable K-FAC design and its applicability in convolutional neural network (CNN) training at scale. We study optimization techniques such as layer-wise distribution strategies, inverse-free second-order gradient evaluation, and dynamic K-FAC update decoupling to reduce training time while preserving convergence. We use residual neural networks (ResNet) applied to the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1k datasets to evaluate the correctness and scalability of our K-FAC gradient preconditioner. With ResNet-50 on the ImageNet-1k dataset, our distributed K-FAC implementation converges to the 75.9% MLPerf baseline in 18-25% less time than does the classic stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer across scales on a GPU cluster.

There have been many attempts to use second-order optimization methods for training deep neural networks. Inspired by diagonal approximations and factored approximations such as Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC), we propose a new approximation to the Fisher information matrix (FIM) called Trace-restricted Kronecker-factored Approximate Curvature (TKFAC) in this work, which can hold the certain trace relationship between the exact and the approximate FIM. In TKFAC, we decompose each block of the approximate FIM as a Kronecker product of two smaller matrices and scaled by a coefficient related to trace. We theoretically analyze TKFAC's approximation error and give an upper bound of it. We also propose a new damping technique for TKFAC on convolutional neural networks to maintain the superiority of second-order optimization methods during training. Experiments show that our method has better performance compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms on some deep network architectures.

We quantify the tradeoffs between memory and communication cost and evaluate KAISA on large models, including ResNet-50, Mask R-CNN, U-Net, and BERT, on up to 128 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Compared to the original optimizers, KAISA converges 18.1-36.3% faster across applications with the same global batch size. Under a fixed memory budget, KAISA converges 32.5% and 41.6% faster in ResNet-50 and BERT-Large, respectively. KAISA can balance memory and communication to achieve scaling efficiency equal to or better than the baseline optimizers. KAISA is open source and available at this https URL.

- Accelerating Distributed K-FAC with Smart Parallelism of Computing and Communication Tasks [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06533)

  - 2021
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Distributed training with synchronous stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on GPU clusters has been widely used to accelerate the training process of deep models. However, SGD only utilizes the first-order gradient in model parameter updates, which may take days or weeks. Recent studies have successfully exploited approximate second-order information to speed up the training process, in which the Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC) emerges as one of the most efficient approximation algorithms for training deep models. Yet, when leveraging GPU clusters to train models with distributed KFAC (D-KFAC), it incurs extensive computation as well as introduces extra communications during each iteration. In this work, we propose D-KFAC (SPD-KFAC) with smart parallelism of computing and communication tasks to reduce the iteration time. Specifically, 1) we first characterize the performance bottlenecks of D-KFAC, 2) we design and implement a pipelining mechanism for Kronecker factors computation and communication with dynamic tensor fusion, and 3) we develop a load balancing placement for inverting multiple matrices on GPU clusters. We conduct real-world experiments on a 64-GPU cluster with 100Gb/s InfiniBand interconnect. Experimental results show that our proposed SPD-KFAC training scheme can achieve 10%-35% improvement over state-of-the-art algorithms.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The second-order optimization methods, notably the D-KFAC (Distributed Kronecker Factored Approximate Curvature) algorithms, have gained traction on accelerating deep neural network (DNN) training on GPU clusters. However, existing D-KFAC algorithms require to compute and communicate a large volume of second-order information, i.e., Kronecker factors (KFs), before preconditioning gradients, resulting in large computation and communication overheads as well as a high memory footprint. In this paper, we propose DP-KFAC, a novel distributed preconditioning scheme that distributes the KF constructing tasks at different DNN layers to different workers. DP-KFAC not only retains the convergence property of the existing D-KFAC algorithms but also enables three benefits: reduced computation overhead in constructing KFs, no communication of KFs, and low memory footprint. Extensive experiments on a 64-GPU cluster show that DP-KFAC reduces the computation overhead by 1.55x-1.65x, the communication cost by 2.79x-3.15x, and the memory footprint by 1.14x-1.47x in each second-order update compared to the state-of-the-art D-KFAC methods.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Several studies have shown the ability of natural gradient descent to minimize the objective function more efficiently than ordinary gradient descent based methods. However, the bottleneck of this approach for training deep neural networks lies in the prohibitive cost of solving a large dense linear system corresponding to the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) at each iteration. This has motivated various approximations of either the exact FIM or the empirical one. The most sophisticated of these is KFAC, which involves a Kronecker-factored block diagonal approximation of the FIM. With only a slight additional cost, a few improvements of KFAC from the standpoint of accuracy are proposed. The common feature of the four novel methods is that they rely on a direct minimization problem, the solution of which can be computed via the Kronecker product singular value decomposition technique. Experimental results on the three standard deep auto-encoder benchmarks showed that they provide more accurate approximations to the FIM. Furthermore, they outperform KFAC and state-of-the-art first-order methods in terms of optimization speed.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Pipeline parallelism enables efficient training of Large Language Models (LLMs) on large-scale distributed accelerator clusters. Yet, pipeline bubbles during startup and tear-down reduce the utilization of accelerators. Although efficient pipeline schemes with micro-batching and bidirectional pipelines have been proposed to maximize utilization, a significant number of bubbles cannot be filled using synchronous forward and backward passes. To address this problem, we suggest that extra work be assigned to the bubbles to gain auxiliary benefits in LLM training. As an example in this direction, we propose PipeFisher, which assigns the work of K-FAC, a second-order optimization method based on the Fisher information matrix, to the bubbles to accelerate convergence. In Phase 1 pretraining of BERT-Base and -Large models, PipeFisher reduces the (simulated) training time to 50-75% compared to training with a first-order optimizer by greatly improving the accelerator utilization and benefiting from the improved convergence by K-FAC.

## Shampoo

  - 2018
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Preconditioned gradient methods are among the most general and powerful tools in optimization. However, preconditioning requires storing and manipulating prohibitively large matrices. We describe and analyze a new structure-aware preconditioning algorithm, called Shampoo, for stochastic optimization over tensor spaces. Shampoo maintains a set of preconditioning matrices, each of which operates on a single dimension, contracting over the remaining dimensions. We establish convergence guarantees in the stochastic convex setting, the proof of which builds upon matrix trace inequalities. Our experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning models show that Shampoo is capable of converging considerably faster than commonly used optimizers. Although it involves a more complex update rule, Shampoo's runtime per step is comparable to that of simple gradient methods such as SGD, AdaGrad, and Adam.

  - 2020
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Optimization in machine learning, both theoretical and applied, is presently dominated by first-order gradient methods such as stochastic gradient descent. Second-order optimization methods, that involve second derivatives and/or second order statistics of the data, are far less prevalent despite strong theoretical properties, due to their prohibitive computation, memory and communication costs. In an attempt to bridge this gap between theoretical and practical optimization, we present a scalable implementation of a second-order preconditioned method (concretely, a variant of full-matrix Adagrad), that along with several critical algorithmic and numerical improvements, provides significant convergence and wall-clock time improvements compared to conventional first-order methods on state-of-the-art deep models. Our novel design effectively utilizes the prevalent heterogeneous hardware architecture for training deep models, consisting of a multicore CPU coupled with multiple accelerator units. We demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art on very large learning tasks such as machine translation with Transformers, language modeling with BERT, click-through rate prediction on Criteo, and image classification on ImageNet with ResNet-50.

  - 2023
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Adaptive regularization methods that exploit more than the diagonal entries exhibit state of the art performance for many tasks, but can be prohibitive in terms of memory and running time. We find the spectra of the Kronecker-factored gradient covariance matrix in deep learning (DL) training tasks are concentrated on a small leading eigenspace that changes throughout training, motivating a low-rank sketching approach. We describe a generic method for reducing memory and compute requirements of maintaining a matrix preconditioner using the Frequent Directions (FD) sketch. While previous approaches have explored applying FD for second-order optimization, we present a novel analysis which allows efficient interpolation between resource requirements and the degradation in regret guarantees with rank k: in the online convex optimization (OCO) setting over dimension d, we match full-matrix d2 memory regret using only dk memory up to additive error in the bottom d−k eigenvalues of the gradient covariance. Further, we show extensions of our work to Shampoo, resulting in a method competitive in quality with Shampoo and Adam, yet requiring only sub-linear memory for tracking second moments.

- Sketchy Empirical Natural Gradient Methods for Deep Learning [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05924)
  - Minghan Yang, Dong Xu, Zaiwen Wen, Mengyun Chen, Pengxiang Xu.
  - 2020
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In this paper, we develop an efficient sketchy empirical natural gradient method (SENG) for large-scale deep learning problems. The empirical Fisher information matrix is usually low-rank since the sampling is only practical on a small amount of data at each iteration. Although the corresponding natural gradient direction lies in a small subspace, both the computational cost and memory requirement are still not tractable due to the high dimensionality. We design randomized techniques for different neural network structures to resolve these challenges. For layers with a reasonable dimension, sketching can be performed on a regularized least squares subproblem. Otherwise, since the gradient is a vectorization of the product between two matrices, we apply sketching on the low-rank approximations of these matrices to compute the most expensive parts. A distributed version of SENG is also developed for extremely large-scale applications. Global convergence to stationary points is established under some mild assumptions and a fast linear convergence is analyzed under the neural tangent kernel (NTK) case. Extensive experiments on convolutional neural networks show the competitiveness of SENG compared with the state-of-the-art methods. On the task ResNet50 with ImageNet-1k, SENG achieves 75.9\% Top-1 testing accuracy within 41 epochs. Experiments on the distributed large-batch training show that the scaling efficiency is quite reasonable.

## PSGD

- Preconditioned Stochastic Gradient Descent [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04202)
  - Xi-Lin Li.
  - 2015
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) still is the workhorse for many practical problems. However, it converges slow, and can be difficult to tune. It is possible to precondition SGD to accelerate its convergence remarkably. But many attempts in this direction either aim at solving specialized problems, or result in significantly more complicated methods than SGD. This paper proposes a new method to estimate a preconditioner such that the amplitudes of perturbations of preconditioned stochastic gradient match that of the perturbations of parameters to be optimized in a way comparable to Newton method for deterministic optimization. Unlike the preconditioners based on secant equation fitting as done in deterministic quasi-Newton methods, which assume positive definite Hessian and approximate its inverse, the new preconditioner works equally well for both convex and non-convex optimizations with exact or noisy gradients. When stochastic gradient is used, it can naturally damp the gradient noise to stabilize SGD. Efficient preconditioner estimation methods are developed, and with reasonable simplifications, they are applicable to large scaled problems. Experimental results demonstrate that equipped with the new preconditioner, without any tuning effort, preconditioned SGD can efficiently solve many challenging problems like the training of a deep neural network or a recurrent neural network requiring extremely long term memories.

- Black Box Lie Group Preconditioners for SGD [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04422)
  - Xi-Lin Li.
  - 2022
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> A matrix free and a low rank approximation preconditioner are proposed to accelerate the convergence of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) by exploiting curvature information sampled from Hessian-vector products or finite differences of parameters and gradients similar to the BFGS algorithm. Both preconditioners are fitted with an online updating manner minimizing a criterion that is free of line search and robust to stochastic gradient noise, and further constrained to be on certain connected Lie groups to preserve their corresponding symmetry or invariance, e.g., orientation of coordinates by the connected general linear group with positive determinants. The Lie group's equivariance property facilitates preconditioner fitting, and its invariance property saves any need of damping, which is common in second-order optimizers, but difficult to tune. The learning rate for parameter updating and step size for preconditioner fitting are naturally normalized, and their default values work well in most situations.
  
## GGT

  - 2018
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Adaptive regularization methods pre-multiply a descent direction by a preconditioning matrix. Due to the large number of parameters of machine learning problems, full-matrix preconditioning methods are prohibitively expensive. We show how to modify full-matrix adaptive regularization in order to make it practical and effective. We also provide a novel theoretical analysis for adaptive regularization in non-convex optimization settings. The core of our algorithm, termed GGT, consists of the efficient computation of the inverse square root of a low-rank matrix. Our preliminary experiments show improved iteration-wise convergence rates across synthetic tasks and standard deep learning benchmarks, and that the more carefully-preconditioned steps sometimes lead to a better solution.

- Amortized Proximal Optimization [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00089)

  - 2022
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a framework for online meta-optimization of parameters that govern optimization, called Amortized Proximal Optimization (APO). We first interpret various existing neural network optimizers as approximate stochastic proximal point methods which trade off the current-batch loss with proximity terms in both function space and weight space. The idea behind APO is to amortize the minimization of the proximal point objective by meta-learning the parameters of an update rule. We show how APO can be used to adapt a learning rate or a structured preconditioning matrix. Under appropriate assumptions, APO can recover existing optimizers such as natural gradient descent and KFAC. It enjoys low computational overhead and avoids expensive and numerically sensitive operations required by some second-order optimizers, such as matrix inverses. We empirically test APO for online adaptation of learning rates and structured preconditioning matrices for regression, image reconstruction, image classification, and natural language translation tasks. Empirically, the learning rate schedules found by APO generally outperform optimal fixed learning rates and are competitive with manually tuned decay schedules. Using APO to adapt a structured preconditioning matrix generally results in optimization performance competitive with second-order methods. Moreover, the absence of matrix inversion provides numerical stability, making it effective for low precision training.

## BFGS

- On the limited memory BFGS method for large scale optimization [[paper]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01589116)
  - Dong C. Liu, Jorge Nocedal 
  - 1989
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We study the numerical performance of a limited memory quasi-Newton method for large scale optimization, which we call the L-BFGS method. We compare its performance with that of the method developed by Buckley and LeNir (1985), which combines cycles of BFGS steps and conjugate direction steps. Our numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than the method of Buckley and LeNir, and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show that the L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method. However we find that for other problems the L-BFGS method is very competitive due to its low iteration cost. We also study the convergence properties of the L-BFGS method, and prove global convergence on uniformly convex problems.

- Practical Quasi-Newton Methods for Training Deep Neural Networks [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08877)
  - Donald Goldfarb, Yi Ren, Achraf Bahamou
  - 2020
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We consider the development of practical stochastic quasi-Newton, and in particular Kronecker-factored block-diagonal BFGS and L-BFGS methods, for training deep neural networks (DNNs). In DNN training, the number of variables and components of the gradient n is often of the order of tens of millions and the Hessian has n2 elements. Consequently, computing and storing a full n×n BFGS approximation or storing a modest number of (step, change in gradient) vector pairs for use in an L-BFGS implementation is out of the question. In our proposed methods, we approximate the Hessian by a block-diagonal matrix and use the structure of the gradient and Hessian to further approximate these blocks, each of which corresponds to a layer, as the Kronecker product of two much smaller matrices. This is analogous to the approach in KFAC, which computes a Kronecker-factored block-diagonal approximation to the Fisher matrix in a stochastic natural gradient method. Because the indefinite and highly variable nature of the Hessian in a DNN, we also propose a new damping approach to keep the upper as well as the lower bounds of the BFGS and L-BFGS approximations bounded. In tests on autoencoder feed-forward neural network models with either nine or thirteen layers applied to three datasets, our methods outperformed or performed comparably to KFAC and state-of-the-art first-order stochastic methods.

Our method is practical, easy to use, scales nicely to very large datasets, and isn't limited in applicability to auto-encoders, or any specific model class. We also discuss the issue of "pathological curvature" as a possible explanation for the difficulty of deep-learning and how 2nd-order optimization, and our method in particular, effectively deals with it.

- Hessian-free Optimization for Learning Deep Multidimensional Recurrent Neural Networks [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03475)

  - 2015
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Multidimensional recurrent neural networks (MDRNNs) have shown a remarkable performance in the area of speech and handwriting recognition. The performance of an MDRNN is improved by further increasing its depth, and the difficulty of learning the deeper network is overcome by using Hessian-free (HF) optimization. Given that connectionist temporal classification (CTC) is utilized as an objective of learning an MDRNN for sequence labeling, the non-convexity of CTC poses a problem when applying HF to the network. As a solution, a convex approximation of CTC is formulated and its relationship with the EM algorithm and the Fisher information matrix is discussed. An MDRNN up to a depth of 15 layers is successfully trained using HF, resulting in an improved performance for sequence labeling.

- Small steps and giant leaps: Minimal Newton solvers for Deep Learning [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08095)
  - João F. Henriques, Sebastien Ehrhardt, Samuel Albanie, Andrea Vedaldi
  - 2018
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a fast second-order method that can be used as a drop-in replacement for current deep learning solvers. Compared to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), it only requires two additional forward-mode automatic differentiation operations per iteration, which has a computational cost comparable to two standard forward passes and is easy to implement. Our method addresses long-standing issues with current second-order solvers, which invert an approximate Hessian matrix every iteration exactly or by conjugate-gradient methods, a procedure that is both costly and sensitive to noise. Instead, we propose to keep a single estimate of the gradient projected by the inverse Hessian matrix, and update it once per iteration. This estimate has the same size and is similar to the momentum variable that is commonly used in SGD. No estimate of the Hessian is maintained. We first validate our method, called CurveBall, on small problems with known closed-form solutions (noisy Rosenbrock function and degenerate 2-layer linear networks), where current deep learning solvers seem to struggle. We then train several large models on CIFAR and ImageNet, including ResNet and VGG-f networks, where we demonstrate faster convergence with no hyperparameter tuning. Code is available.

- Equilibrated adaptive learning rates for non-convex optimization [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04390)
  - Yann N. Dauphin, Harm de Vries, Yoshua Bengio
  - 2015
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Parameter-specific adaptive learning rate methods are computationally efficient ways to reduce the ill-conditioning problems encountered when training large deep networks. Following recent work that strongly suggests that most of the critical points encountered when training such networks are saddle points, we find how considering the presence of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian could help us design better suited adaptive learning rate schemes. We show that the popular Jacobi preconditioner has undesirable behavior in the presence of both positive and negative curvature, and present theoretical and empirical evidence that the so-called equilibration preconditioner is comparatively better suited to non-convex problems. We introduce a novel adaptive learning rate scheme, called ESGD, based on the equilibration preconditioner. Our experiments show that ESGD performs as well or better than RMSProp in terms of convergence speed, always clearly improving over plain stochastic gradient descent.

- ADAHESSIAN: An Adaptive Second Order Optimizer for Machine Learning [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00719)
  - Zhewei Yao, Amir Gholami, Sheng Shen, Mustafa Mustafa, Kurt Keutzer, Michael W. Mahoney
  - 2020
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We introduce ADAHESSIAN, a second order stochastic optimization algorithm which dynamically incorporates the curvature of the loss function via ADAptive estimates of the HESSIAN. Second order algorithms are among the most powerful optimization algorithms with superior convergence properties as compared to first order methods such as SGD and Adam. The main disadvantage of traditional second order methods is their heavier per iteration computation and poor accuracy as compared to first order methods. To address these, we incorporate several novel approaches in ADAHESSIAN, including: (i) a fast Hutchinson based method to approximate the curvature matrix with low computational overhead; (ii) a root-mean-square exponential moving average to smooth out variations of the Hessian diagonal across different iterations; and (iii) a block diagonal averaging to reduce the variance of Hessian diagonal elements. We show that ADAHESSIAN achieves new state-of-the-art results by a large margin as compared to other adaptive optimization methods, including variants of Adam. In particular, we perform extensive tests on CV, NLP, and recommendation system tasks and find that ADAHESSIAN: (i) achieves 1.80%/1.45% higher accuracy on ResNets20/32 on Cifar10, and 5.55% higher accuracy on ImageNet as compared to Adam; (ii) outperforms AdamW for transformers by 0.13/0.33 BLEU score on IWSLT14/WMT14 and 2.7/1.0 PPL on PTB/Wikitext-103; (iii) outperforms AdamW for SqueezeBert by 0.41 points on GLUE; and (iv) achieves 0.032% better score than Adagrad for DLRM on the Criteo Ad Kaggle dataset. Importantly, we show that the cost per iteration of ADAHESSIAN is comparable to first order methods, and that it exhibits robustness towards its hyperparameters.

- Noisy Natural Gradient as Variational Inference [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02390)
  - Guodong Zhang, Shengyang Sun, David Duvenaud, Roger Grosse
  - 2017
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Variational Bayesian neural nets combine the flexibility of deep learning with Bayesian uncertainty estimation. Unfortunately, there is a tradeoff between cheap but simple variational families (e.g.~fully factorized) or expensive and complicated inference procedures. We show that natural gradient ascent with adaptive weight noise implicitly fits a variational posterior to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO). This insight allows us to train full-covariance, fully factorized, or matrix-variate Gaussian variational posteriors using noisy versions of natural gradient, Adam, and K-FAC, respectively, making it possible to scale up to modern-size ConvNets. On standard regression benchmarks, our noisy K-FAC algorithm makes better predictions and matches Hamiltonian Monte Carlo's predictive variances better than existing methods. Its improved uncertainty estimates lead to more efficient exploration in active learning, and intrinsic motivation for reinforcement learning.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Bayesian methods promise to fix many shortcomings of deep learning, but they are impractical and rarely match the performance of standard methods, let alone improve them. In this paper, we demonstrate practical training of deep networks with natural-gradient variational inference. By applying techniques such as batch normalisation, data augmentation, and distributed training, we achieve similar performance in about the same number of epochs as the Adam optimiser, even on large datasets such as ImageNet. Importantly, the benefits of Bayesian principles are preserved: predictive probabilities are well-calibrated, uncertainties on out-of-distribution data are improved, and continual-learning performance is boosted. This work enables practical deep learning while preserving benefits of Bayesian principles. A PyTorch implementation is available as a plug-and-play optimiser.

- Natural Gradient Works Efficiently in Learning [[paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6790500)
  - Shun-ichi Amari
  - 1998
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> When a parameter space has a certain underlying structure, the ordinary gradient of a function does not represent its steepest direction, but the natural gradient does. Information geometry is used for calculating the natural gradients in the parameter space of perceptrons, the space of matrices (for blind source separation), and the space of linear dynamical systems (for blind source deconvolution). The dynamical behavior of natural gradient online learning is analyzed and is proved to be Fisher efficient, implying that it has asymptotically the same performance as the optimal batch estimation of parameters. This suggests that the plateau phenomenon, which appears in the backpropagation learning algorithm of multilayer perceptrons, might disappear or might not be so serious when the natural gradient is used. An adaptive method of updating the learning rate is proposed and analyzed.

Our result- ing algorithm is competitive against state- of-the-art first order optimisation methods, with sometimes significant improvement in optimisation performance. Unlike first-order methods, for which hyperparameter tuning of the optimisation parameters is often a labo- rious process, our approach can provide good performance even when used with default set- tings. A side result of our work is that for piecewise linear transfer functions, the net- work objective function can have no differ- entiable local maxima, which may partially explain why such transfer functions facilitate effective optimisation.

- Second-Order Neural ODE Optimizer [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14158)
  - Guan-Horng Liu, Tianrong Chen, Evangelos A. Theodorou
  - 2021
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a novel second-order optimization framework for training the emerging deep continuous-time models, specifically the Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). Since their training already involves expensive gradient computation by solving a backward ODE, deriving efficient second-order methods becomes highly nontrivial. Nevertheless, inspired by the recent Optimal Control (OC) interpretation of training deep networks, we show that a specific continuous-time OC methodology, called Differential Programming, can be adopted to derive backward ODEs for higher-order derivatives at the same O(1) memory cost. We further explore a low-rank representation of the second-order derivatives and show that it leads to efficient preconditioned updates with the aid of Kronecker-based factorization. The resulting method -- named SNOpt -- converges much faster than first-order baselines in wall-clock time, and the improvement remains consistent across various applications, e.g. image classification, generative flow, and time-series prediction. Our framework also enables direct architecture optimization, such as the integration time of Neural ODEs, with second-order feedback policies, strengthening the OC perspective as a principled tool of analyzing optimization in deep learning. Our code is available at this https URL.

- Three Mechanisms of Weight Decay Regularization [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12281)
  - Guodong Zhang, Chaoqi Wang, Bowen Xu, Roger Grosse
  - 2018
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Weight decay is one of the standard tricks in the neural network toolbox, but the reasons for its regularization effect are poorly understood, and recent results have cast doubt on the traditional interpretation in terms of L2 regularization. Literal weight decay has been shown to outperform L2 regularization for optimizers for which they differ. We empirically investigate weight decay for three optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, and K-FAC) and a variety of network architectures. We identify three distinct mechanisms by which weight decay exerts a regularization effect, depending on the particular optimization algorithm and architecture: (1) increasing the effective learning rate, (2) approximately regularizing the input-output Jacobian norm, and (3) reducing the effective damping coefficient for second-order optimization. Our results provide insight into how to improve the regularization of neural networks.

- Limitations of the Empirical Fisher Approximation for Natural Gradient Descent [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12558)
  - Frederik Kunstner, Lukas Balles, Philipp Hennig
  - 2019
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Natural gradient descent, which preconditions a gradient descent update with the Fisher information matrix of the underlying statistical model, is a way to capture partial second-order information. Several highly visible works have advocated an approximation known as the empirical Fisher, drawing connections between approximate second-order methods and heuristics like Adam. We dispute this argument by showing that the empirical Fisher---unlike the Fisher---does not generally capture second-order information. We further argue that the conditions under which the empirical Fisher approaches the Fisher (and the Hessian) are unlikely to be met in practice, and that, even on simple optimization problems, the pathologies of the empirical Fisher can have undesirable effects.

  - 2019
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Increasing the batch size is a popular way to speed up neural network training, but beyond some critical batch size, larger batch sizes yield diminishing returns. In this work, we study how the critical batch size changes based on properties of the optimization algorithm, including acceleration and preconditioning, through two different lenses: large scale experiments, and analysis of a simple noisy quadratic model (NQM). We experimentally demonstrate that optimization algorithms that employ preconditioning, specifically Adam and K-FAC, result in much larger critical batch sizes than stochastic gradient descent with momentum. We also demonstrate that the NQM captures many of the essential features of real neural network training, despite being drastically simpler to work with. The NQM predicts our results with preconditioned optimizers, previous results with accelerated gradient descent, and other results around optimal learning rates and large batch training, making it a useful tool to generate testable predictions about neural network optimization.

- Whitening and second order optimization both make information in the dataset unusable during training, and can reduce or prevent generalization [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07545)
  - Neha S. Wadia, Daniel Duckworth, Samuel S. Schoenholz, Ethan Dyer, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein
  - 2020
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Machine learning is predicated on the concept of generalization: a model achieving low error on a sufficiently large training set should also perform well on novel samples from the same distribution. We show that both data whitening and second order optimization can harm or entirely prevent generalization. In general, model training harnesses information contained in the sample-sample second moment matrix of a dataset. For a general class of models, namely models with a fully connected first layer, we prove that the information contained in this matrix is the only information which can be used to generalize. Models trained using whitened data, or with certain second order optimization schemes, have less access to this information, resulting in reduced or nonexistent generalization ability. We experimentally verify these predictions for several architectures, and further demonstrate that generalization continues to be harmed even when theoretical requirements are relaxed. However, we also show experimentally that regularized second order optimization can provide a practical tradeoff, where training is accelerated but less information is lost, and generalization can in some circumstances even improve.

- Online Natural Gradient as a Kalman Filter [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00209)
  - Yann Ollivier
  - 2017
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We cast Amari's natural gradient in statistical learning as a specific case of Kalman filtering. Namely, applying an extended Kalman filter to estimate a fixed unknown parameter of a probabilistic model from a series of observations, is rigorously equivalent to estimating this parameter via an online stochastic natural gradient descent on the log-likelihood of the observations. In the i.i.d. case, this relation is a consequence of the "information filter" phrasing of the extended Kalman filter. In the recurrent (state space, non-i.i.d.) case, we prove that the joint Kalman filter over states and parameters is a natural gradient on top of real-time recurrent learning (RTRL), a classical algorithm to train recurrent models. This exact algebraic correspondence provides relevant interpretations for natural gradient hyperparameters such as learning rates or initialization and regularization of the Fisher information matrix.

  - Shun-ichi Amari, Tomoko Ozeki, Ryo Karakida, Yuki Yoshida, Masato Okada
  - 2018
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The dynamics of supervised learning play a main role in deep learning, which takes place in the parameter space of a multilayer perceptron (MLP). We review the history of supervised stochastic gradient learning, focusing on its singular structure and natural gradient. The parameter space includes singular regions in which parameters are not identifiable. One of our results is a full exploration of the dynamical behaviors of stochastic gradient learning in an elementary singular network. The bad news is its pathological nature, in which part of the singular region becomes an attractor and another part a repulser at the same time, forming a Milnor attractor. A learning trajectory is attracted by the attractor region, staying in it for a long time, before it escapes the singular region through the repulser region. This is typical of plateau phenomena in learning. We demonstrate the strange topology of a singular region by introducing blow-down coordinates, which are useful for analyzing the natural gradient dynamics. We confirm that the natural gradient dynamics are free of critical slowdown. The second main result is the good news: the interactions of elementary singular networks eliminate the attractor part and the Milnor-type attractors disappear. This explains why large-scale networks do not suffer from serious critical slowdowns due to singularities. We finally show that the unit-wise natural gradient is effective for learning in spite of its low computational cost.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) remains the method of choice for deep learning, despite the limitations arising for ill-behaved objective functions. In cases where it could be estimated, the natural gradient has proven very effective at mitigating the catastrophic effects of pathological curvature in the objective function, but little is known theoretically about its convergence properties, and it has yet to find a practical implementation that would scale to very deep and large networks. Here, we derive an exact expression for the natural gradient in deep linear networks, which exhibit pathological curvature similar to the nonlinear case. We provide for the first time an analytical solution for its convergence rate, showing that the loss decreases exponentially to the global minimum in parameter space. Our expression for the natural gradient is surprisingly simple, computationally tractable, and explains why some approximations proposed previously work well in practice. This opens new avenues for approximating the natural gradient in the nonlinear case, and we show in preliminary experiments that our online natural gradient descent outperforms SGD on MNIST autoencoding while sharing its computational simplicity.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Natural Gradient Descent (NGD) helps to accelerate the convergence of gradient descent dynamics, but it requires approximations in large-scale deep neural networks because of its high computational cost. Empirical studies have confirmed that some NGD methods with approximate Fisher information converge sufficiently fast in practice. Nevertheless, it remains unclear from the theoretical perspective why and under what conditions such heuristic approximations work well. In this work, we reveal that, under specific conditions, NGD with approximate Fisher information achieves the same fast convergence to global minima as exact NGD. We consider deep neural networks in the infinite-width limit, and analyze the asymptotic training dynamics of NGD in function space via the neural tangent kernel. In the function space, the training dynamics with the approximate Fisher information are identical to those with the exact Fisher information, and they converge quickly. The fast convergence holds in layer-wise approximations; for instance, in block diagonal approximation where each block corresponds to a layer as well as in block tri-diagonal and K-FAC approximations. We also find that a unit-wise approximation achieves the same fast convergence under some assumptions. All of these different approximations have an isotropic gradient in the function space, and this plays a fundamental role in achieving the same convergence properties in training. Thus, the current study gives a novel and unified theoretical foundation with which to understand NGD methods in deep learning.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> While second order optimizers such as natural gradient descent (NGD) often speed up optimization, their effect on generalization has been called into question. This work presents a more nuanced view on how the \textit{implicit bias} of first- and second-order methods affects the comparison of generalization properties. We provide an exact asymptotic bias-variance decomposition of the generalization error of overparameterized ridgeless regression under a general class of preconditioner P, and consider the inverse population Fisher information matrix (used in NGD) as a particular example. We determine the optimal P for both the bias and variance, and find that the relative generalization performance of different optimizers depends on the label noise and the "shape" of the signal (true parameters): when the labels are noisy, the model is misspecified, or the signal is misaligned with the features, NGD can achieve lower risk; conversely, GD generalizes better than NGD under clean labels, a well-specified model, or aligned signal. Based on this analysis, we discuss several approaches to manage the bias-variance tradeoff, and the potential benefit of interpolating between GD and NGD. We then extend our analysis to regression in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space and demonstrate that preconditioned GD can decrease the population risk faster than GD. Lastly, we empirically compare the generalization error of first- and second-order optimizers in neural network experiments, and observe robust trends matching our theoretical analysis.

  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Natural gradient descent is an optimization method traditionally motivated from the perspective of information geometry, and works well for many applications as an alternative to stochastic gradient descent. In this paper we critically analyze this method and its properties, and show how it can be viewed as a type of 2nd-order optimization method, with the Fisher information matrix acting as a substitute for the Hessian. In many important cases, the Fisher information matrix is shown to be equivalent to the Generalized Gauss-Newton matrix, which both approximates the Hessian, but also has certain properties that favor its use over the Hessian. This perspective turns out to have significant implications for the design of a practical and robust natural gradient optimizer, as it motivates the use of techniques like trust regions and Tikhonov regularization. Additionally, we make a series of contributions to the understanding of natural gradient and 2nd-order methods, including: a thorough analysis of the convergence speed of stochastic natural gradient descent (and more general stochastic 2nd-order methods) as applied to convex quadratics, a critical examination of the oft-used 'empirical' approximation of the Fisher matrix, and an analysis of the (approximate) parameterization invariance property possessed by natural gradient methods (which we show also holds for certain other curvature matrices, but notably not the Hessian).
