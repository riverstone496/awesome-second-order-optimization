## K-FAC

- Optimizing Neural Networks with Kronecker-factored Approximate Curvature [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05671)
  - James Martens, Roger Grosse.
  - 2015
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose an efficient method for approximating natural gradient descent in neural networks which we call Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC). K-FAC is based on an efficiently invertible approximation of a neural network's Fisher information matrix which is neither diagonal nor low-rank, and in some cases is completely non-sparse. It is derived by approximating various large blocks of the Fisher (corresponding to entire layers) as being the Kronecker product of two much smaller matrices. While only several times more expensive to compute than the plain stochastic gradient, the updates produced by K-FAC make much more progress optimizing the objective, which results in an algorithm that can be much faster than stochastic gradient descent with momentum in practice. And unlike some previously proposed approximate natural-gradient/Newton methods which use high-quality non-diagonal curvature matrices (such as Hessian-free optimization), K-FAC works very well in highly stochastic optimization regimes. This is because the cost of storing and inverting K-FAC's approximation to the curvature matrix does not depend on the amount of data used to estimate it, which is a feature typically associated only with diagonal or low-rank approximations to the curvature matrix.

- A Kronecker-factored approximate Fisher matrix for convolution layers [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01407)
  - Roger Grosse, James Martens.
  - 2016
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Second-order optimization methods such as natural gradient descent have the potential to speed up training of neural networks by correcting for the curvature of the loss function. Unfortunately, the exact natural gradient is impractical to compute for large models, and most approximations either require an expensive iterative procedure or make crude approximations to the curvature. We present Kronecker Factors for Convolution (KFC), a tractable approximation to the Fisher matrix for convolutional networks based on a structured probabilistic model for the distribution over backpropagated derivatives. Similarly to the recently proposed Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC), each block of the approximate Fisher matrix decomposes as the Kronecker product of small matrices, allowing for efficient inversion. KFC captures important curvature information while still yielding comparably efficient updates to stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We show that the updates are invariant to commonly used reparameterizations, such as centering of the activations. In our experiments, approximate natural gradient descent with KFC was able to train convolutional networks several times faster than carefully tuned SGD. Furthermore, it was able to train the networks in 10-20 times fewer iterations than SGD, suggesting its potential applicability in a distributed setting.

- Kronecker-factored Curvature Approximations for Recurrent Neural Networks [[paper]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyMTkQZAb)
  - James Martens, Jimmy Ba, Matt Johnson.
  - 2018
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Kronecker-factor Approximate Curvature (Martens & Grosse, 2015) (K-FAC) is a 2nd-order optimization method which has been shown to give state-of-the-art performance on large-scale neural network optimization tasks (Ba et al., 2017).  It is based on an approximation to the Fisher information matrix (FIM) that makes assumptions about the particular structure of the network and the way it is parameterized. The original K-FAC method was applicable only to fully-connected networks, although it has been recently extended by Grosse & Martens (2016) to handle convolutional networks as well. In this work we extend the method to handle RNNs by introducing a novel approximation to the FIM for RNNs. This approximation works by modelling the covariance structure between the gradient contributions at different time-steps using a chain-structured linear Gaussian graphical model, summing the various cross-covariances, and computing the inverse in closed form. We demonstrate in experiments that our method significantly outperforms general purpose state-of-the-art optimizers like SGD with momentum and Adam on several challenging RNN training tasks.

- Fast Approximate Natural Gradient Descent in a Kronecker-factored Eigenbasis [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03884)
  - Thomas George, César Laurent, Xavier Bouthillier, Nicolas Ballas, Pascal Vincent.
  - 2018
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Optimization algorithms that leverage gradient covariance information, such as variants of natural gradient descent (Amari, 1998), offer the prospect of yielding more effective descent directions. For models with many parameters, the covariance matrix they are based on becomes gigantic, making them inapplicable in their original form. This has motivated research into both simple diagonal approximations and more sophisticated factored approximations such as KFAC (Heskes, 2000; Martens & Grosse, 2015; Grosse & Martens, 2016). In the present work we draw inspiration from both to propose a novel approximation that is provably better than KFAC and amendable to cheap partial updates. It consists in tracking a diagonal variance, not in parameter coordinates, but in a Kronecker-factored eigenbasis, in which the diagonal approximation is likely to be more effective. Experiments show improvements over KFAC in optimization speed for several deep network architectures.

- Eigenvalue-corrected Natural Gradient Based on a New Approximation [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13609)
  - Kai-Xin Gao, Xiao-Lei Liu, Zheng-Hai Huang, Min Wang, Shuangling Wang, Zidong Wang, Dachuan Xu, Fan Yu.
  - 2020
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Using second-order optimization methods for training deep neural networks (DNNs) has attracted many researchers. A recently proposed method, Eigenvalue-corrected Kronecker Factorization (EKFAC) (George et al., 2018), proposes an interpretation of viewing natural gradient update as a diagonal method, and corrects the inaccurate re-scaling factor in the Kronecker-factored eigenbasis. Gao et al. (2020) considers a new approximation to the natural gradient, which approximates the Fisher information matrix (FIM) to a constant multiplied by the Kronecker product of two matrices and keeps the trace equal before and after the approximation. In this work, we combine the ideas of these two methods and propose Trace-restricted Eigenvalue-corrected Kronecker Factorization (TEKFAC). The proposed method not only corrects the inexact re-scaling factor under the Kronecker-factored eigenbasis, but also considers the new approximation method and the effective damping technique proposed in Gao et al. (2020). We also discuss the differences and relationships among the Kronecker-factored approximations. Empirically, our method outperforms SGD with momentum, Adam, EKFAC and TKFAC on several DNNs.

- KAISA: An Adaptive Second-Order Optimizer Framework for Deep Neural Networks [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01739)
  - J. Gregory Pauloski, Qi Huang, Lei Huang, Shivaram Venkataraman, Kyle Chard, Ian Foster, Zhao Zhang.
  - 2021
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Kronecker-factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) has recently been shown to converge faster in deep neural network (DNN) training than stochastic gradient descent (SGD); however, K-FAC's larger memory footprint hinders its applicability to large models. We present KAISA, a K-FAC-enabled, Adaptable, Improved, and ScAlable second-order optimizer framework that adapts the memory footprint, communication, and computation given specific models and hardware to improve performance and increase scalability. We quantify the tradeoffs between memory and communication cost and evaluate KAISA on large models, including ResNet-50, Mask R-CNN, U-Net, and BERT, on up to 128 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Compared to the original optimizers, KAISA converges 18.1-36.3% faster across applications with the same global batch size. Under a fixed memory budget, KAISA converges 32.5% and 41.6% faster in ResNet-50 and BERT-Large, respectively. KAISA can balance memory and communication to achieve scaling efficiency equal to or better than the baseline optimizers. KAISA is open source and available at this https URL.

- SKFAC: Training Neural Networks with Faster Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature [[paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9578481)
  - Zedong Tang; Fenlong Jiang; Maoguo Gong; Hao Li; Yue Wu; Fan Yu; Zidong Wang; Min Wang.
  - 2021
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The bottleneck of computation burden limits the widespread use of the 2nd order optimization algorithms for training deep neural networks. In this paper, we present a computationally efficient approximation for natural gradient descent, named Swift Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (SKFAC), which combines Kronecker factorization and a fast low-rank matrix inversion technique. Our research aims at both fully connected and convolutional layers. For the fully connected layers, by utilizing the low-rank property of Kronecker factors of Fisher information matrix, our method only requires inverting a small matrix to approximate the curvature with desirable accuracy. For convolutional layers, we propose a way with two strategies to save computational efforts without affecting the empirical performance by reducing across the spatial dimension or receptive fields of feature maps. Specifically, we propose two effective dimension reduction methods for this purpose: Spatial Subsampling and Reduce Sum. Experimental results of training several deep neural networks on Cifar-10 and ImageNet-1k datasets demonstrate that SKFAC can capture the main curvature and yield comparative performance to K-FAC. The proposed method bridges the wall-clock time gap between the 1st and 2nd order algorithms.

- M-FAC: Efficient Matrix-Free Approximations of Second-Order Information [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03356)
  - Elias Frantar, Eldar Kurtic, Dan Alistarh.
  - 2021
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Efficiently approximating local curvature information of the loss function is a key tool for optimization and compression of deep neural networks. Yet, most existing methods to approximate second-order information have high computational or storage costs, which can limit their practicality. In this work, we investigate matrix-free, linear-time approaches for estimating Inverse-Hessian Vector Products (IHVPs) for the case when the Hessian can be approximated as a sum of rank-one matrices, as in the classic approximation of the Hessian by the empirical Fisher matrix. We propose two new algorithms as part of a framework called M-FAC: the first algorithm is tailored towards network compression and can compute the IHVP for dimension d, if the Hessian is given as a sum of m rank-one matrices, using O(dm2) precomputation, O(dm) cost for computing the IHVP, and query cost O(m) for any single element of the inverse Hessian. The second algorithm targets an optimization setting, where we wish to compute the product between the inverse Hessian, estimated over a sliding window of optimization steps, and a given gradient direction, as required for preconditioned SGD. We give an algorithm with cost O(dm+m2) for computing the IHVP and O(dm+m3) for adding or removing any gradient from the sliding window. These two algorithms yield state-of-the-art results for network pruning and optimization with lower computational overhead relative to existing second-order methods. Implementations are available at [9] and [17].

- Gradient Descent on Neurons and its Link to Approximate Second-Order Optimization [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12250)
  - Frederik Benzing.
  - 2022
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Second-order optimizers are thought to hold the potential to speed up neural network training, but due to the enormous size of the curvature matrix, they typically require approximations to be computationally tractable. The most successful family of approximations are Kronecker-Factored, block-diagonal curvature estimates (KFAC). Here, we combine tools from prior work to evaluate exact second-order updates with careful ablations to establish a surprising result: Due to its approximations, KFAC is not closely related to second-order updates, and in particular, it significantly outperforms true second-order updates. This challenges widely held believes and immediately raises the question why KFAC performs so well. Towards answering this question we present evidence strongly suggesting that KFAC approximates a first-order algorithm, which performs gradient descent on neurons rather than weights. Finally, we show that this optimizer often improves over KFAC in terms of computational cost and data-efficiency.

- Eva: A General Vectorized Approximation Framework for Second-order Optimization [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02123)
  - Lin Zhang, Shaohuai Shi, Bo Li.
  - 2022
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Second-order optimization algorithms exhibit excellent convergence properties for training deep learning models, but often incur significant computation and memory overheads. This can result in lower training efficiency than the first-order counterparts such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In this work, we present a memory- and time-efficient second-order algorithm named Eva with two novel techniques: 1) we construct the second-order information with the Kronecker factorization of small stochastic vectors over a mini-batch of training data to reduce memory consumption, and 2) we derive an efficient update formula without explicitly computing the inverse of matrices using the Sherman-Morrison formula. We further extend Eva to a general vectorized approximation framework to improve the compute and memory efficiency of two existing second-order algorithms (FOOF and Shampoo) without affecting their convergence performance. Extensive experimental results on different models and datasets show that Eva reduces the end-to-end training time up to 2.05x and 2.42x compared to first-order SGD and second-order algorithms (K-FAC and Shampoo), respectively.


- Scalable K-FAC Training for Deep Neural Networks with Distributed Preconditioning [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01685)
  - Lin Zhang, Shaohuai Shi, Wei Wang, Bo Li.
  - 2022
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> The second-order optimization methods, notably the D-KFAC (Distributed Kronecker Factored Approximate Curvature) algorithms, have gained traction on accelerating deep neural network (DNN) training on GPU clusters. However, existing D-KFAC algorithms require to compute and communicate a large volume of second-order information, i.e., Kronecker factors (KFs), before preconditioning gradients, resulting in large computation and communication overheads as well as a high memory footprint. In this paper, we propose DP-KFAC, a novel distributed preconditioning scheme that distributes the KF constructing tasks at different DNN layers to different workers. DP-KFAC not only retains the convergence property of the existing D-KFAC algorithms but also enables three benefits: reduced computation overhead in constructing KFs, no communication of KFs, and low memory footprint. Extensive experiments on a 64-GPU cluster show that DP-KFAC reduces the computation overhead by 1.55x-1.65x, the communication cost by 2.79x-3.15x, and the memory footprint by 1.14x-1.47x in each second-order update compared to the state-of-the-art D-KFAC methods.

- MKOR: Momentum-Enabled Kronecker-Factor-Based Optimizer Using Rank-1 Updates [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01685)
  - Mohammad Mozaffari, Sikan Li, Zhao Zhang, Maryam Mehri Dehnavi.
  - 2023
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> This work proposes a Momentum-Enabled Kronecker-Factor-Based Optimizer Using Rank-1 updates, called MKOR, that improves the training time and convergence properties of deep neural networks (DNNs). Second-order techniques, while enjoying higher convergence rates vs first-order counterparts, have cubic complexity with respect to either the model size and/or the training batch size. Hence they exhibit poor scalability and performance in transformer models, e.g. large language models (LLMs), because the batch sizes in these models scale by the attention mechanism sequence length, leading to large model size and batch sizes. MKOR's complexity is quadratic with respect to the model size, alleviating the computation bottlenecks in second-order methods. Because of their high computation complexity, state-of-the-art implementations of second-order methods can only afford to update the second order information infrequently, and thus do not fully exploit the promise of better convergence from these updates. By reducing the communication complexity of the second-order updates as well as achieving a linear communication complexity, MKOR increases the frequency of second order updates. We also propose a hybrid version of MKOR (called MKOR-H) that mid-training falls backs to a first order optimizer if the second order updates no longer accelerate convergence. Our experiments show that MKOR outperforms state -of-the-art first order methods, e.g. the LAMB optimizer, and best implementations of second-order methods, i.e. KAISA/KFAC, up to 2.57x and 1.85x respectively on BERT-Large-Uncased on 64 GPUs.



## Shampoo

- Shampoo: Preconditioned Stochastic Tensor Optimization [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09568)
  - Vineet Gupta, Tomer Koren, Yoram Singer.
  - 2018
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Preconditioned gradient methods are among the most general and powerful tools in optimization. However, preconditioning requires storing and manipulating prohibitively large matrices. We describe and analyze a new structure-aware preconditioning algorithm, called Shampoo, for stochastic optimization over tensor spaces. Shampoo maintains a set of preconditioning matrices, each of which operates on a single dimension, contracting over the remaining dimensions. We establish convergence guarantees in the stochastic convex setting, the proof of which builds upon matrix trace inequalities. Our experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning models show that Shampoo is capable of converging considerably faster than commonly used optimizers. Although it involves a more complex update rule, Shampoo's runtime per step is comparable to that of simple gradient methods such as SGD, AdaGrad, and Adam.

- Scalable Second Order Optimization for Deep Learning [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09018)
  - Rohan Anil, Vineet Gupta, Tomer Koren, Kevin Regan, Yoram Singer.
  - 2020
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Optimization in machine learning, both theoretical and applied, is presently dominated by first-order gradient methods such as stochastic gradient descent. Second-order optimization methods, that involve second derivatives and/or second order statistics of the data, are far less prevalent despite strong theoretical properties, due to their prohibitive computation, memory and communication costs. In an attempt to bridge this gap between theoretical and practical optimization, we present a scalable implementation of a second-order preconditioned method (concretely, a variant of full-matrix Adagrad), that along with several critical algorithmic and numerical improvements, provides significant convergence and wall-clock time improvements compared to conventional first-order methods on state-of-the-art deep models. Our novel design effectively utilizes the prevalent heterogeneous hardware architecture for training deep models, consisting of a multicore CPU coupled with multiple accelerator units. We demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art on very large learning tasks such as machine translation with Transformers, language modeling with BERT, click-through rate prediction on Criteo, and image classification on ImageNet with ResNet-50.

- Sketchy: Memory-efficient Adaptive Regularization with Frequent Directions [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03764)
  - Vladimir Feinberg, Xinyi Chen, Y. Jennifer Sun, Rohan Anil, Elad Hazan.
  - 2023
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Adaptive regularization methods that exploit more than the diagonal entries exhibit state of the art performance for many tasks, but can be prohibitive in terms of memory and running time. We find the spectra of the Kronecker-factored gradient covariance matrix in deep learning (DL) training tasks are concentrated on a small leading eigenspace that changes throughout training, motivating a low-rank sketching approach. We describe a generic method for reducing memory and compute requirements of maintaining a matrix preconditioner using the Frequent Directions (FD) sketch. While previous approaches have explored applying FD for second-order optimization, we present a novel analysis which allows efficient interpolation between resource requirements and the degradation in regret guarantees with rank k: in the online convex optimization (OCO) setting over dimension d, we match full-matrix d2 memory regret using only dk memory up to additive error in the bottom d−k eigenvalues of the gradient covariance. Further, we show extensions of our work to Shampoo, resulting in a method competitive in quality with Shampoo and Adam, yet requiring only sub-linear memory for tracking second moments.

  - 2023
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We present practical Levenberg-Marquardt variants of Gauss-Newton and natural gradient methods for solving non-convex optimization problems that arise in training deep neural networks involving enormous numbers of variables and huge data sets. Our methods use subsampled Gauss-Newton or Fisher information matrices and either subsampled gradient estimates (fully stochastic) or full gradients (semi-stochastic), which, in the latter case, we prove convergent to a stationary point. By using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula with automatic differentiation (backpropagation) we show how our methods can be implemented to perform efficiently. Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

- Sketchy Empirical Natural Gradient Methods for Deep Learning [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05924)
  - Minghan Yang, Dong Xu, Zaiwen Wen, Mengyun Chen, Pengxiang Xu.
  - 2020
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> In this paper, we develop an efficient sketchy empirical natural gradient method (SENG) for large-scale deep learning problems. The empirical Fisher information matrix is usually low-rank since the sampling is only practical on a small amount of data at each iteration. Although the corresponding natural gradient direction lies in a small subspace, both the computational cost and memory requirement are still not tractable due to the high dimensionality. We design randomized techniques for different neural network structures to resolve these challenges. For layers with a reasonable dimension, sketching can be performed on a regularized least squares subproblem. Otherwise, since the gradient is a vectorization of the product between two matrices, we apply sketching on the low-rank approximations of these matrices to compute the most expensive parts. A distributed version of SENG is also developed for extremely large-scale applications. Global convergence to stationary points is established under some mild assumptions and a fast linear convergence is analyzed under the neural tangent kernel (NTK) case. Extensive experiments on convolutional neural networks show the competitiveness of SENG compared with the state-of-the-art methods. On the task ResNet50 with ImageNet-1k, SENG achieves 75.9\% Top-1 testing accuracy within 41 epochs. Experiments on the distributed large-batch training show that the scaling efficiency is quite reasonable.

## PSGD

- Preconditioned Stochastic Gradient Descent [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04202)
  - Xi-Lin Li.
  - 2015
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) still is the workhorse for many practical problems. However, it converges slow, and can be difficult to tune. It is possible to precondition SGD to accelerate its convergence remarkably. But many attempts in this direction either aim at solving specialized problems, or result in significantly more complicated methods than SGD. This paper proposes a new method to estimate a preconditioner such that the amplitudes of perturbations of preconditioned stochastic gradient match that of the perturbations of parameters to be optimized in a way comparable to Newton method for deterministic optimization. Unlike the preconditioners based on secant equation fitting as done in deterministic quasi-Newton methods, which assume positive definite Hessian and approximate its inverse, the new preconditioner works equally well for both convex and non-convex optimizations with exact or noisy gradients. When stochastic gradient is used, it can naturally damp the gradient noise to stabilize SGD. Efficient preconditioner estimation methods are developed, and with reasonable simplifications, they are applicable to large scaled problems. Experimental results demonstrate that equipped with the new preconditioner, without any tuning effort, preconditioned SGD can efficiently solve many challenging problems like the training of a deep neural network or a recurrent neural network requiring extremely long term memories.

- Black Box Lie Group Preconditioners for SGD [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04422)
  - Xi-Lin Li.
  - 2022
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> A matrix free and a low rank approximation preconditioner are proposed to accelerate the convergence of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) by exploiting curvature information sampled from Hessian-vector products or finite differences of parameters and gradients similar to the BFGS algorithm. Both preconditioners are fitted with an online updating manner minimizing a criterion that is free of line search and robust to stochastic gradient noise, and further constrained to be on certain connected Lie groups to preserve their corresponding symmetry or invariance, e.g., orientation of coordinates by the connected general linear group with positive determinants. The Lie group's equivariance property facilitates preconditioner fitting, and its invariance property saves any need of damping, which is common in second-order optimizers, but difficult to tune. The learning rate for parameter updating and step size for preconditioner fitting are naturally normalized, and their default values work well in most situations.
  
## GGT

- Efficient Full-Matrix Adaptive Regularization [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02958)
  - Naman Agarwal, Brian Bullins, Xinyi Chen, Elad Hazan, Karan Singh, Cyril Zhang, Yi Zhang
  - 2018
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> Adaptive regularization methods pre-multiply a descent direction by a preconditioning matrix. Due to the large number of parameters of machine learning problems, full-matrix preconditioning methods are prohibitively expensive. We show how to modify full-matrix adaptive regularization in order to make it practical and effective. We also provide a novel theoretical analysis for adaptive regularization in non-convex optimization settings. The core of our algorithm, termed GGT, consists of the efficient computation of the inverse square root of a low-rank matrix. Our preliminary experiments show improved iteration-wise convergence rates across synthetic tasks and standard deep learning benchmarks, and that the more carefully-preconditioned steps sometimes lead to a better solution.

- Amortized Proximal Optimization [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00089)
  - Juhan Bae, Paul Vicol, Jeff Z. HaoChen, Roger Grosse.
  - 2022
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We propose a framework for online meta-optimization of parameters that govern optimization, called Amortized Proximal Optimization (APO). We first interpret various existing neural network optimizers as approximate stochastic proximal point methods which trade off the current-batch loss with proximity terms in both function space and weight space. The idea behind APO is to amortize the minimization of the proximal point objective by meta-learning the parameters of an update rule. We show how APO can be used to adapt a learning rate or a structured preconditioning matrix. Under appropriate assumptions, APO can recover existing optimizers such as natural gradient descent and KFAC. It enjoys low computational overhead and avoids expensive and numerically sensitive operations required by some second-order optimizers, such as matrix inverses. We empirically test APO for online adaptation of learning rates and structured preconditioning matrices for regression, image reconstruction, image classification, and natural language translation tasks. Empirically, the learning rate schedules found by APO generally outperform optimal fixed learning rates and are competitive with manually tuned decay schedules. Using APO to adapt a structured preconditioning matrix generally results in optimization performance competitive with second-order methods. Moreover, the absence of matrix inversion provides numerical stability, making it effective for low precision training.

## BFGS

- Practical Quasi-Newton Methods for Training Deep Neural Networks [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08877)
  - Donald Goldfarb, Yi Ren, Achraf Bahamou
  - 2020
  - <details><summary>Digest</summary> We consider the development of practical stochastic quasi-Newton, and in particular Kronecker-factored block-diagonal BFGS and L-BFGS methods, for training deep neural networks (DNNs). In DNN training, the number of variables and components of the gradient n is often of the order of tens of millions and the Hessian has n2 elements. Consequently, computing and storing a full n×n BFGS approximation or storing a modest number of (step, change in gradient) vector pairs for use in an L-BFGS implementation is out of the question. In our proposed methods, we approximate the Hessian by a block-diagonal matrix and use the structure of the gradient and Hessian to further approximate these blocks, each of which corresponds to a layer, as the Kronecker product of two much smaller matrices. This is analogous to the approach in KFAC, which computes a Kronecker-factored block-diagonal approximation to the Fisher matrix in a stochastic natural gradient method. Because the indefinite and highly variable nature of the Hessian in a DNN, we also propose a new damping approach to keep the upper as well as the lower bounds of the BFGS and L-BFGS approximations bounded. In tests on autoencoder feed-forward neural network models with either nine or thirteen layers applied to three datasets, our methods outperformed or performed comparably to KFAC and state-of-the-art first-order stochastic methods.
